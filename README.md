Fix the current code to make the compiler happy. All variables **HAVE** to be *strings* and identifiers **MUST** be *Java legal*. 

## Instructions
1. All data types must be *Strings*
1. Rename the illegal identifiers 
1. Initialize the variable under the INITIALIZATION section
1. With a field of 35, leave each line of the stanza to be right justified
1. The writer of the haiku must be left justified with no fixed width

***Recall:***
```java
// The structure of formatting:
System.out.printf(format, argument);
```

*As for the format syntax: *
```java
// %<flags><width><.precision>specifier
ex: System.out.printf("%-10.2f", 5.009); => 5.01  
```
